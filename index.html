    <p>My favority animal is a dog. My top 3 favorite characteristics of dogs are the funny actions they do and how unpredictable they can be at times, despite how long one would have them for. My second favorite characteristic is their love is like no other compared to most animals. My third is how protective they can be for the people and animals they love. </p>
